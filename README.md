# SynchronizedQueue

## Project Description:
An OS programming academic project. In this project I have implemented a utility that allows the user to search for files that contain some given pattern in a root folder, and to copy the matched files to a destination folder.
The program uses several threads of searchers and copiers that share an implemented synchronized queue.
